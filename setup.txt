//To do:
Pass just Ether to contract
or...can we have the tokens on the mainchain and everything else off chain?


We would need to pass:
M -> C:
Info to start contract
Account balances at end

C->M
Token creation event would pass tokens to mainchain
Once calculated, info would need to be passed to mainchain for withdrawals of locked Ether
